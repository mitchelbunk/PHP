        Tamed Bloodstalkers latch onto survivors and provide the survivor with height and enhanced vision (Known as
        "Spider Vision", similar to Tek Helmet pulse mode). Due to its nature, this Creature can latch onto branches and
        attachable walls with its silk and swing from one end to another, latching onto another while swinging. Holding
        LEFT CTRL button will cause the blood stalker to fall slowly. It jumps upwards twice, with additional jumps
        every successful momentum.
        <br>
        However, mastering the web slinging is tricky, if not useful. Left Mouse button slings one web either at the
        wall or at a target, whereas Right Mouse button sling both webs. Where the bloodstalker is aiming its web at can
        be determined by where the circle target is currently aiming. Holding the corresponding left/right mouse button
        pulls the bloodstalker towards the attached area/creature, building momentum, and when pressing jump right, will
        allow it to jump farther up than intended. The web will remain on the bloodstalker until either LEFT CTRL button
        or jump button is used, allowing the survivor to latch onto certain creature in suspension.
        <br>
        Some creatures and players can be webbed and pulled in for a feast. Bloodstalker will feast on such creature's
        blood, replenishing both its Health and Food. However, be careful as other creatures can still attack you. Press
        X to cancel the feast.
        <br>
        Moreover, if the survivor pulls out a Weapon, it will adjust itself upwards to allow for a clearer shot. It
        enters into water walking mode, and can switch to swimming (via submerging) by using the "X" button (L1 and L3
        on console). If however, the bloodstalker's Health falls below 40%, it will slowly drain the survivor's health
        until it goes above it. You can also keep Blood Packs in your inventory to feed your spider instead of it being
        fed by you.
